    title: "Associate Frontend Developer",
    description:
      <>A fintech startup that helps people optimize budgets, save for expenses, and automate payments. I worked as the sole frontend developer at Lint Finance, where I redesigned the existing dashboard and extended it with new features. This included implementing the virtual card system where users could generate and manage their cards, building out the complete user onboarding experience with multi-step forms and validation, and developing the payroll and wallet management interfaces that handle financial transactions and account data.
      <div style={{marginTop: "12px"}}>
        I focused on improving the app's performance and search visibility, and set up our technical documentation system with Docusaurus so the team could easily reference how everything worked. I collaborated directly with product managers, backend engineers, QA testers, designers, and the mobile team to make sure features worked smoothly across all platforms.

    title: "Frontend Developer Intern @ HNG",
    description:
      <>The HNG internship is a fast-paced bootcamp where thousands compete on real-world projects. I contributed to an open-source boilerplate and worked on the dashboard of an AI-powered tool called Tifi.
      <div style={{marginTop: "12px"}}>
        One highlight was leading the transition of Tifi from client-side to server-side rendering, significantly improving SEO and performance. Out of 24,123 participants, I finished among the 523 finalists—an experience that demanded focus, resilience under pressure, and the ability to deliver under tight schedules.

    title: "Frontend Developer @ Kadosh Mechatronics",
    description:
      <>At this early-stage startup focused on Embedded Systems, Robotics, and STEM education, I wore many hats. I programmed robots and built web interfaces to interact with them for clients—often solving problems we hadn’t seen before. I also developed a private, custom-built web-based inventory system that tracked tools and usage, which improved team productivity. 
      <div style={{marginTop: "12px"}}>
        Beyond coding, I taught web development and embedded systems, while mentoring and coordinating  interns and new engineers. This gave me hands-on leadership experience and the chance to help others grow.

    title: "Frontend Developer Intern @ OFNL",
    description:
      <>At an agricultural tech firm improving input supply, financing, and marketing services, I worked on developing a desktop application using React and Electron that helped farmers manage their crop planning, track inventory, and coordinate with suppliers.
      <div style={{marginTop: "12px"}}>
        This was my first experience working on a team, and I learned not just coding practices but also how to assist teammates and help them grow—an early lesson in collaboration and empathy.

    description:
      "I developed a web application that handled online voting, event ticketing, and opinion polling. The platform processed payments through Paystack and Flutterwave APIs, and included an admin dashboard where organizers could track event sales, vote counts, and revenue analytics. The platform supported several events and handled over 23,000 user visits with thousands of votes processed.",
